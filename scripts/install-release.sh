# This file enforces the ownership boundary, and it is the only part of the
# deploy that deletes anything on the server:
#
#   CI-OWNED  - every path in RELEASE_PATHS. Removed, then replaced. This is what
#               stops a file deleted from the repository lingering on the VPS and
#               being compiled into a later build.
#   VPS-OWNED - everything else in the target. Never touched: the
#               leftovers from the old git-clone deploy, operator-created files.
#
# This is why the deploy does not simply extract over the target, and why it does
# not use drone-scp's rm:true - that option removes the WHOLE target directory
# (verified in the plugin source: `if p.Config.Remove { ssh.Run(rmcmd(target)) }`),
# taking production secrets and data with it.
#
# It therefore never removes the target directory itself. `rm -rf "$TARGET"`,
# `docker compose down -v` and `docker volume rm` must never appear in a routine
# deploy.
